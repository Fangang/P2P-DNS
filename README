======== Installation ========

You need a SSL certificate for your node, just generate one:

openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes 

This is not a problem since we use ssl just for encryption, not authentication.
Note: The certificate needs to be named server.pem and reside in the same dir as
 the source code. If you don't like that, commit a patch.

You might also need the zmq module. If you are using Ubuntu, it's easy to 
install:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/zeromq  
sudo aptitude update
sudo aptitude install python-zeromq

======== Usage ==========

To start the normal DNS server, type: 'twistd -y dns-server.py'
To launch the actual p2p-dns server, use 'python p2p-dns.py' 
or './p2p-dns.py'
